Life is about cycles...

- This year, **2025**, is about to end. I was diagnosed with BAP (Broad Autism Phenotype) and I am very close to reaching high abilities. 

- Seven years ago **2018**, I had a toxic work relationship with a team I led, and I developed an autoimmune thyroid disease. 

- Seven years before that **2011**, I suffered from depression.

> In Vedic astrology, it is believed that cycles occur every seven years. Others, more modern, in the 20th century, say that life is like the chakras: each stage is linked to a chakra in seven-year periods.

- I was diagnosed with an autoimmune thyroid disease at around 38 years old. **The fifth chakra**, Vishuddha, is connected to the throat and the thyroid.

- In 2011, I didn't accept myself. I was between 27 and 28 years old. **The fourth chakra**, the heart chakra: Anahata. Accepting and loving oneself and others.

- In 2004-2005, I struggled with my studies. **The third chakra**. Solar plexus. Manipura. It governs self-confidence and ability. I started gaining weight.

Now 2025 is ending. I just started **the 6th chakra**. I'm entering a new phase. Intuition, wisdom, a broader perspective on life. Each phase has started slowly and progressed. I didn't start off very well, to be honest, but I've been improving. 

A new cycle has begun! 

# Happy new year 2026!
