# Sacred Mind, Different Design

A few months ago, at 1 am on a Saturday night, I asked myself: *Why not talk about the things that I have in my head?*

That simple question grew into something much bigger. It became a realization that I have too many things to share, across too many dimensions of my life. And instead of choosing one lane, I decided to embrace all of them.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog is a **sanctuary for the unconventional mind**—a space where technology, spirituality, self-discovery, and creative expression converge.

You can expect posts about:

**Tech & Innovation**
**Spiritual Healing & Self-Discovery**
**Trainings & Knowledge Sharing**
**House Music Movement**
**Gaming**
**Health & Being Human**
## Why All of This?

Because **I am all of this**. I'm not just a tech guy who dabbles in spirituality. I'm not just a spiritual healer with a day job in SAP. I'm not just a father, a husband, a gamer, or a House music enthusiast.

At 42, I discovered I have a different kind of mind—what some call BAP (Broader Autism Phenotype) and High Capacities. My whole life I felt different, like I didn't fit. Now I understand: **my mind doesn't work in a straight line. It moves in networks, connections, patterns, and spirals.**

This blog honors that. It's a reflection of how I actually think—non-linear, pattern-seeking, drawing threads between seemingly unrelated fields. And if you're reading this, maybe your mind works similarly.


## An Invitation

This blog is an invitation to think differently, to honor the multiple selves within us, and to recognize that **being different isn't a bug—it's a feature.**

Welcome to *Sacred Mind, Different Design*.

This is where I'm learning to integrate all of myself and I'm grateful you're here to witness it.

Let's explore together.
