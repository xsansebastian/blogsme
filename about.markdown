Greetings world.

It was a saturday night at 1 am that I tell to myself  *Why to not talk about the things that I have in my head* The initial idea was just to express myself and share my thoughs. 6h later, telling to myself if I just have to talk about myself, about techie topics, about my process of being healthy, talk about the importante that music and dance has in mental health, if I have to talk about my inner spiritual discovery of the last years or just a mixture of all of them. And then for each topic I already have more than 5 topics that I want to talk. At least, I slept a little bit :) So... I really don't know  what I'm going to talk about... I tried  almost 5 times to write this without any result ...

I'm a SAP techy guy that believes in Agile in the more raw mindset (to have better and quickly outcomes you have to be constantly observing and adjusting the process), I belive that AI revolution is the biggest revolution and will change everything and I love trying to help teams and people to be able to do their job better. 

I'm happily married and father of two girls. At my 39yr I started a process of self discovering, that brings me to try to understand how the univers works in a spiritual holistic way. All my life I though that I was different, that I wasn't fit in this world. 42 years late I know that I have a BAP (Broader Authism Phenotype) and very close to High Capacities.

I love House music *Soulful, Afro, Disco, Deep, Chicago House...* and dance. The rythms, the sounds, the meanings of them let's yourself to go out of your body and flows like a free spirit fulled connected to Univers. I probably go back to djing for fun at home.... I'm really excited about it! 

I love playing games, if I have to choose one kind, probably mmorpgs, but in general all rpgs flavours. 

I've been playing football all my life, being a healthy guy till the late years of university.  Now I'm tryign to be again the same, a healthy guy without hair in my head and a big beard :)

So if I have to define myself in a phrase.

**I'm a father. I'm a husband. I'm a techy guy. I'm a HouseMusic lover. I'm a spiritual healer. I'm a Gamer**
